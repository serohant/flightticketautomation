    ## Summary
    This system has been developed as an automation for easy ticket purchasing and high-quality flight experiences. It is designed to enable users from all walks of life to easily handle their transactions and to prefer this project for many reasons. Our user-friendly interface, ease of use, secure flights, passenger comfort, and cost-effective solutions are significant factors that make users choose this system. This project has been meticulously developed considering every detail to meet users' needs and aims to become one of the leading airline automations.

    ## Entrance
    The project is designed as a console application where users can easily manage their airport ticket operations. The system starts with a welcome screen offering four main options: Log In, Sign Up, About Us, and Exit. In the Sign-Up screen, users are asked to provide their first name, last name, username, and password, and this information is stored in memory. After a successful sign-up process, users are redirected to the log-in screen. In the log-in screen, the username and password are verified, granting access to the main page. The About Us screen provides information about the application, and users can choose to go back or exit. In the Exit screen, users are thanked, and the application is closed. On the main page, users can choose from options like buy ticket, check ticket, my account, and exit. In the buy ticket screen, users can enter details such as departure and arrival cities, airports, number of passengers, flight type, and ticket class. The flight type can be one-way or round-trip, and the ticket class options are Business or Economy. In the flight listing screen, 3-5 random flights are generated based on the user's criteria, and the price is calculated using specific formulas. When users confirm the ticket details, the ticket information is printed on the screen, and they are returned to the main page. In the check ticket screen, users are asked to enter a 6-digit ticket number, and if this number matches the record in memory, the ticket details are printed on the screen. The system aims to provide a user-friendly experience with all its features, enabling quick and efficient ticket operations. I extend my thanks to the instructor at my school.
